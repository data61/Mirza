Public keys are transmitted using ASN.1 protocol, encoded either in DER form or PEM, which is the DER form base64 with headers and footers.

use HsOpenSSL library

OpenSSL.PEM & OpenSSL.DER

PEM is what we'll probably get the key in, and want to give back to users
We may want to store it in DER in the database, because it's more compact.
